# Seattle_2015_Rain_and_Traffic_Analsis
I started this project to get a little graphing practice done while exploring two Seattle data sets. 
The first data set pulled from the National Oceanic and Atmosphiric Administration https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/, 
gives us a detailed look into Seattle's weather patterns for the year 2015. And the other data set pulled from
the city of Seattle's data https://data.seattle.gov/ website provides us with information concerning traffic 
collisions for the same year.
